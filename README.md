## <div id='intro'>Introduction</div>

This repo is associated with the survey paper "[Delving into the Devils of Birdâ€™s-eye-view Perception: A Review, Evaluation and Recipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05324)", which provides an up-to-date literature survey for BEV percption and an open source BEV toolbox based on PyTorch. We also introduce BEV algorithm family, incluidng follow-up work on BEV percepton such as [VCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15670), [GAPretrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03105) and [FocalDistiller](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zeng_Distilling_Focal_Knowledge_From_Imperfect_Expert_for_3D_Object_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.html). We hope this repo can not only be a good starting point for new beginners but also help current researchers in the BEV perception community.
<!-- In the literature survey, it includes different modalities (camera, lidar and fusion) and tasks (detection and segmentation). As for the toolbox, it provides useful recipe for BEV camera-based 3D object detection, including solid data augmentation strategies, efficient BEV encoder design, loss function family, useful test-time augmentation, ensemble policy, and so on. -->

### Major Features

* **SOTA BEV Algorithm Family** <br> We include important follow-up works of BEVFormer/BEVDet/BEVDepth in different aspects, ranging from plug-and-play tricks to knowledge distillation([GAPretrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03105), [FocalDistiller]((https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zeng_Distilling_Focal_Knowledge_From_Imperfect_Expert_for_3D_Object_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.html))). More detail of each paper can be found in each README.md file under [here](./nuScenes_playground/).
* **Convenient BEVPerception Toolbox** <br> We integrate bag of tricks in the BEV toolbox that help us achieve 1st in the camera-based detection track of the Waymo Open Challenge 2022, which can be used indedependly or as a plug-in for `mmdet3d` and `detectron2`. Moreover, we provide a suitable playground for new-beginners in this area, including hands-on tutorial and small-scale dataset (1/5 WOD in kitti format) to validate idea. More detail can be found [here](./bev_toolbox/README.md).

## <div id='overview'>Literature Survey</div>

![](figs/general_overview.jpg)
The general picture of BEV perception at a glance, where consists of three sub-parts based on the input modality. BEV perception is a general task built on top of a series of fundamental tasks. For better completeness of the whole perception algorithms in autonomous driving, we list other topics as well. More detail can be found in the [survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05324).

We have summarized important datasets and methods in recent years about BEV perception in academia and also different roadmaps used in industry.
